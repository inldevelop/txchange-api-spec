# txchange

txchange is an API to allow consumers to participate as shippers or carriers in a 
Truck Exchange system to allow them to post loads (as shippers) so carriers can take those 
loads and move them from origin to destination according to the load posts terms and keep 
the shippers informed on every moment about the load location and status.

There are three user roles:
+ `shipper`
+ `carrier`
+ `admin`

Some resources and actions are limited to certain user roles. For example, only users with
the `shipper` role can post new loads and only users with the `admin` user role can 
register new users. 

Some actions behave different according to the user role. For example, listing loads will 
bring all the loads posted by a user with `shipper` role or the load taken by a user with 
`carrier` role.
